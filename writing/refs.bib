    abstract = { This paper reports on the development of social network analysis, tracing its origins in classical sociology and its more recent formulation in social scientific and mathematical work. It is argued that the concept of social network provides a powerful model for social structure, and that a number of important formal methods of social network analysis can be discerned. Social network analysis has been used in studies of kinship structure, social mobility, science citations, contacts among members of deviant groups, corporate power, international trade exploitation, class structure, and many other areas. A review of the formal models proposed in graph theory, multidimensional scaling, and algebraic topology is followed by extended illustrations of social network analysis in the study of community structure and interlocking directorships. }

ABSTRACT = {Link prediction in complex networks has attracted considerable attention from interdisciplinary research communities, due to its ubiquitous applications in biological networks, social networks, transportation networks, telecommunication networks, and, recently, knowledge graphs. Numerous studies utilized link prediction approaches in order sto find missing links or predict the likelihood of future links as well as employed for reconstruction networks, recommender systems, privacy control, etc. This work presents an extensive review of state-of-art methods and algorithms proposed on this subject and categorizes them into four main categories: similarity-based methods, probabilistic methods, relational models, and learning-based methods. Additionally, a collection of network data sets has been presented in this paper, which can be used in order to study link prediction. We conclude this study with a discussion of recent developments and future research directions.},

abstract = {We propose several econometric measures of connectedness based on principal-components analysis and Granger-causality networks, and apply them to the monthly returns of hedge funds, banks, broker/dealers, and insurance companies. We find that all four sectors have become highly interrelated over the past decade, likely increasing the level of systemic risk in the finance and insurance industries through a complex and time-varying network of relationships. These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods, and seem to contain predictive power in out-of-sample tests. Our results show an asymmetry in the degree of connectedness among the four sectors, with banks playing a much more important role in transmitting shocks than other financial institutions.}

Dynamic Spanning Trees (DST) are constructed using an ARMA-FIEGARCH-cDCC process. The main results show that: 1. The DST significantly shrinks over time; 2. Hong Kong is found to be the key financial market; 3. The DST has a significantly increased stability in the last few years; 4. The removal of the key player has two effects: there is no clear key market any longer and the stability of the DST significantly decreases. These results are important for the design of policies that help develop stock markets and for academics and practitioners},
